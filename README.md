# Time-series-analysis-of-Hydropower-consumption-US
The project was part of the course work for the SYDE 631 Time series modeling subject.In this project the goal is to study the time series characterictics and build a model for prediction. The dataset records the hydroelectricity power consumption in US from May 2011 to July 2021. There are two columns in the dataset month-year and their respective energy consumption values. The time series was converted into a time series(ts) class in R and further analysis was performed to understand the distribution of the dataset, outlier analysis and future forecast along with prediction intervals.
